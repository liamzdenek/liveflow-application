# Active Context

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Architecture and Planning Complete, Memory Bank Initialized
**Next Phase**: Foundation Setup

## Recent Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Serverless-first approach**: Full AWS Lambda + API Gateway stack
- **Dual-language strategy**: TypeScript for APIs, Python for ML
- **Stale account pattern**: Efficient batch processing only on changed accounts
- **Single API Lambda**: Consolidated CRUD operations vs. microservices
- **EventBridge scheduling**: 5-minute data generation, 10-minute anomaly detection

### UI/UX Decisions
- **3-page structure**: All transactions, anomalies dashboard, create transaction
- **Dropbox design style**: Flat design, no borders, transparent buttons with thick borders
- **Data-first interface**: Prioritize transaction information over aesthetics
- **ASCII mockups completed**: Clear layout for all three pages

### Data Model Decisions
- **DynamoDB schema**: 3 tables (Accounts, Transactions, Anomalies)
- **Feature engineering**: Pre-compute ML features during transaction storage
- **IsolationForest limitations**: Focus on anomaly scores, not explanations
- **Risk categorization**: HIGH (>0.8), MEDIUM (0.5-0.8), LOW (<0.5)

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Initialize NX Monorepo**: Set up workspace structure
2. **Create Package Structure**: All packages in packages/ directory
3. **Shared Types Package**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all data models
4. **CDK Infrastructure**: Define AWS resources and deployment

### Implementation Priority
1. **Foundation**: NX setup, shared types, basic CDK structure
2. **Data Layer**: DynamoDB tables and basic CRUD operations
3. **API Layer**: Lambda functions with health checks
4. **Frontend**: React dashboard with basic transaction display
5. **ML Component**: Python anomaly detection with IsolationForest
6. **Automation**: EventBridge scheduling and data generation

## Active Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **Cold start performance**: Lambda initialization time for ML libraries
- **DynamoDB query patterns**: Efficient access for dashboard queries
- **IsolationForest model**: Training data requirements and model persistence
- **Build complexity**: Multiple languages and deployment coordination

### Implementation Challenges
- **ML model storage**: Where to persist trained IsolationForest models
- **Feature extraction**: Efficient calculation of rolling window features
- **Real-time updates**: Balance immediate updates vs. eventual consistency
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation for batch job failures

### Open Questions
- **Model retraining**: How often to retrain IsolationForest models
- **Historical data**: Bootstrap strategy for initial anomaly detection
- **Scaling patterns**: How to handle increased transaction volume
- **Monitoring strategy**: Key metrics for operational health

## Environment Readiness

### Prerequisites Status
- ✅ .clinerules defined with project patterns
- ✅ Architecture documented and validated
- ✅ API contracts designed
- ✅ UI mockups completed
- ✅ Memory bank initialized
- ⏳ NX monorepo initialization (next)
- ⏳ AWS environment setup (next)

### Memory Bank Status
- ✅ projectbrief.md - Core requirements and success criteria
- ✅ productContext.md - User experience and business value
- ✅ systemPatterns.md - Architecture patterns and design decisions
- ✅ techContext.md - Technology stack and constraints
- ✅ activeContext.md - Current work focus (this document)
- ⏳ progress.md - Will track implementation progress
- ⏳ apiContracts.md - Detailed API specifications

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Build incrementally**: One package at a time with validation
2. **Deploy early**: Test each component against real AWS resources
3. **Validate continuously**: Use curl/AWS CLI for integration testing
4. **Document learnings**: Update runbook.md with operational insights

### Quality Gates
- Each package must build successfully in dist/ directory
- Health check endpoints must validate dependencies
- API contracts must be validated with test requests
- Frontend must display real data from deployed APIs
- Anomaly detection must process real transaction data

### Success Metrics
- All three pages functional in deployed dashboard
- Anomaly detection identifying unusual transactions
- Real-time transaction creation and balance updates
- End-to-end workflow: data generation → anomaly detection → dashboard display
