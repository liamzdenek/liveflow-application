# Active Context

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: ✅ NX Monorepo Foundation Complete
**Next Phase**: Feature Implementation and AWS Deployment

## Recent Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Serverless-first approach**: Full AWS Lambda + API Gateway stack
- **Dual-language strategy**: TypeScript for APIs, Python for ML
- **Stale account pattern**: Efficient batch processing only on changed accounts
- **Single API Lambda**: Consolidated CRUD operations vs. microservices
- **EventBridge scheduling**: 5-minute data generation, 10-minute anomaly detection

### UI/UX Decisions
- **3-page structure**: All transactions, anomalies dashboard, create transaction
- **Dropbox design style**: Flat design, no borders, transparent buttons with thick borders
- **Data-first interface**: Prioritize transaction information over aesthetics
- **ASCII mockups completed**: Clear layout for all three pages

### Data Model Decisions
- **DynamoDB schema**: 3 tables (Accounts, Transactions, Anomalies)
- **Feature engineering**: Pre-compute ML features during transaction storage
- **IsolationForest limitations**: Focus on anomaly scores, not explanations
- **Risk categorization**: HIGH (>0.8), MEDIUM (0.5-0.8), LOW (<0.5)

## Current Work Focus

### ✅ Foundation Work Completed
1. **✅ NX Monorepo Initialized**: Complete workspace with 6 packages
2. **✅ Package Structure Created**: All packages in packages/ directory
3. **✅ Shared Types Package**: Complete TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation
4. **✅ CDK Infrastructure**: Full AWS serverless stack with all resources
5. **✅ API Package**: Complete production-ready REST API with all endpoints, validation, and .clinerules compliance
6. **✅ Data Generation Package**: Realistic transaction generator Lambda
7. **✅ ML Anomaly Package**: Python package with UV for ML processing
8. **✅ Frontend Package**: React SPA with Vite and TanStack Router

### Next Implementation Priority
1. **Frontend Components**: Dashboard pages and routing implementation
2. **ML Model Implementation**: IsolationForest anomaly detection
3. **AWS Deployment**: Infrastructure deployment and validation
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation
5. **Feature Completion**: Transaction creation and real-time updates
6. **Production Readiness**: Monitoring, logging, and error handling

## Active Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **Cold start performance**: Lambda initialization time for ML libraries
- **DynamoDB query patterns**: Efficient access for dashboard queries
- **IsolationForest model**: Training data requirements and model persistence
- **Build complexity**: Multiple languages and deployment coordination

### Implementation Challenges
- **ML model storage**: Where to persist trained IsolationForest models
- **Feature extraction**: Efficient calculation of rolling window features
- **Real-time updates**: Balance immediate updates vs. eventual consistency
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation for batch job failures

### Open Questions
- **Model retraining**: How often to retrain IsolationForest models
- **Historical data**: Bootstrap strategy for initial anomaly detection
- **Scaling patterns**: How to handle increased transaction volume
- **Monitoring strategy**: Key metrics for operational health

## Environment Readiness

### Foundation Status ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ .clinerules defined with project patterns
- ✅ Architecture documented and validated
- ✅ API contracts designed
- ✅ UI mockups completed
- ✅ Memory bank initialized
- ✅ **NX monorepo foundation complete**
- ✅ **All packages created and building successfully**
- ✅ **Build system configured with single dist/ output**

### Memory Bank Status
- ✅ projectbrief.md - Core requirements and success criteria
- ✅ productContext.md - User experience and business value
- ✅ systemPatterns.md - Architecture patterns and design decisions
- ✅ techContext.md - Technology stack and constraints
- ✅ activeContext.md - Current work focus (this document)
- ✅ progress.md - Implementation progress tracking
- ✅ apiContracts.md - Complete API specifications

### Build Validation ✅ VERIFIED
- ✅ `npx nx run shared:build` - Success
- ✅ `npx nx run api:build` - Success
- ✅ `npx nx run data-generation:build` - Success
- ✅ `npx nx run infrastructure:build` - Success
- ✅ All package dependencies resolved correctly
- ✅ NX caching and dependency graph working

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Build incrementally**: One package at a time with validation
2. **Deploy early**: Test each component against real AWS resources
3. **Validate continuously**: Use curl/AWS CLI for integration testing
4. **Document learnings**: Update runbook.md with operational insights

### Quality Gates
- Each package must build successfully in dist/ directory
- Health check endpoints must validate dependencies
- API contracts must be validated with test requests
- Frontend must display real data from deployed APIs
- Anomaly detection must process real transaction data

### Success Metrics
- All three pages functional in deployed dashboard
- Anomaly detection identifying unusual transactions
- Real-time transaction creation and balance updates
- End-to-end workflow: data generation → anomaly detection → dashboard display
